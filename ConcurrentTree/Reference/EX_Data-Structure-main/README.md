# Data Structure with c++
The goal is to familiarize with using Data Structure.  
Understand the concepts of the Data Structure by **implementing data structures in STL**.  
Furthermore, Aim to strengthen the functions in data structures or add new functions.  
And Solve various problems through data structures implemented by myself.  

All code has comments(English).  
See more details of code or data structure explanation, visit [my blog](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/category/CS/%EC%9E%90%EB%A3%8C%EA%B5%AC%EC%A1%B0%28Data%20Structure%29).  
There are explanations of Data Structure (korean).

*main.cpp is the file that uses each topic.

* * *
### 4. Sort -> [Details](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/146)  
> QuickSort.cpp - Divide-and-conquer algorithm that sorts an array by partitioning it into smaller sub-arrays and recursively sorting those sub-arrays.   

* * *
### 5. Tree -> [Details](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/151)  
> BinarySearchTree.cpp - Binary Search Tree(dynamic version).     
> BinarySearchTree.h

* * *
### 6. Heap -> [Details](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/152)  
> Max_Heap.cpp - Max heap with array.     
> Changed_Heap.cpp  
-The problem of picking the 10 highest priority users given their IDs and properties.  
-The larger the property, the higher the priority, and if the properties are the same, the user with the smaller id has      the higher priority.  
-IDs are given in sequentially increasing order.  

### 7. Segment Tree -> [Details](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/153)  
> segment_tree.cpp - Find the sum of segments.       
> segment_tree_max_min.cpp - find the maximum and minimum values in a segment.  

### 8. Trie -> [Details](https://hagisilecoding.tistory.com/154)  
> trie.cpp - Basic trie tree(insert, remove, find string).         
> trie2.cpp - Find substring at kth occurrence.
